      ],
      "correct_option": "Roles define *what* a user can do (e.g., view, edit), while Groups define *who* the role applies to.",
      "explanation": "This is the core concept of RBP. A Permission Role is a collection of permissions (the \"what\"). A Permission Group defines a population of users (the \"who\"). You grant a role *to* a group to give those users the specified permissions."

      "correct_option": "Administrator Permissions -> Manage Role-Based Permission Access",
      "explanation": "To grant a user the ability to access the RBP admin tool itself, you must grant them this specific permission. Their ability to then manage permissions for others will still be constrained by the target population assigned to them for this role."

      "question": "When configuring the latest Home Page, an admin wants a new 'Health & Safety' custom card to be visible only to employees in the 'Manufacturing' department. How is this targeting technically achieved?",
      "options": [
        "By creating a special URL for the card that only manufacturing employees know.",
        "By assigning the card in 'Manage Home Page' to a permission group that dynamically includes all members of the 'Manufacturing' department.",

      "question": "A user is locked out of their account after too many failed login attempts. Using the 'Reset User Passwords' tool, what specific action(s) must the administrator perform to grant them access again?",

        "The admin only needs to set a new temporary password.",
        "The admin must select the checkbox next to the user's name and click the \"Reset\" button.",

      ],
      "correct_option": "The admin must both set a new password AND select the \"Account Locked\" checkbox to unlock it.",
      "explanation": "A common mistake is to only reset the password. The 'Reset User Passwords' tool has a separate checkbox, often labeled \"Account Locked,\" that must also be checked to clear the locked status. Otherwise, the user will remain locked out even with the new password."

      "question": "In 'Proxy Management,' what prevents an HR assistant, who has been granted proxy access for a company executive, from seeing the executive's sensitive compensation data?",

        "The system automatically redacts sensitive fields when in proxy mode.",

      ],
      "correct_option": "The HR assistant's own RBP role does not grant them permission to view the executive's compensation information.",
      "explanation": "Proxy access is always filtered through the proxy user's own permissions. Even though the assistant is \"acting as\" the executive, they are still bound by their own RBP. If their role doesn't let them see compensation for that target population, they won't see it in proxy mode either."

      "explanation": "The Action Search (and People Search) relies on a Solr search index, not a direct, live database query. This index is updated by a scheduled job (typically nightly). Therefore, a delay can exist between when data is created/changed and when it appears in search results."

      "options": [
        "The admin must re-import the language pack.",
        "The admin must go to the configuration tool for that object (e.g., 'Manage Business Configuration') and manually add the translations for each custom field.",
        "The admin must submit a ticket to SAP to have the custom fields translated.",
